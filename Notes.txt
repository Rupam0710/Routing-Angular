You can add relative path in the root file that is app.component file . (routerLink = "servers")
But you cannot add relative paths in the child folder file because it will give an error and try to find the path i.e. appRootPath/childpath (relative path always try to append with current path)which is not available. 
But if we use absolute path in child component i.e. (routerLink = "/servers") relative path does not try to append with current path and we don't get an error.
